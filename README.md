# My_Online_Showcase

A simple, static personal website built entirely with HTML to showcase basic information, resume, and contact details.

## ‚ú® Overview

This project serves as a basic online presence, demonstrating fundamental HTML structure. It consists of four interconnected pages:

1.  **Home (`index.html`):** A welcoming introduction with a profile picture and navigation links.
2.  **About Me (`about.html`):** Details about interests, hobbies, and a favorite quote.
3.  **Resume (`resume.html`):** Information on education, work experience, skills, and projects (presented in a table with links and images).
4.  **Contact Me (`contact.html`):** Contact information (Email, LinkedIn, GitHub) and a basic HTML form structure (non-functional).

## üîß Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** Used exclusively for structuring the content of all pages. No CSS or JavaScript is applied for styling or interactivity in this basic version.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **index.html**: This is the main landing page of the showcase, providing an overview and navigation to other sections.  
- **about.html**: This page describes your personal interests and background to help visitors get to know you better.  
- **resume.html**: Here you can find a detailed account of your professional and academic experiences.  
- **contact.html**: This page contains your contact information and a basic form for visitors to reach out.  
- **Personal.png**: A profile picture displayed on the main landing page.  
- **Linkedin.jpeg**: An image related to a project, used in the resume.  
- **Github.jpeg**: An image related to a project, also used in the resume.  
- **README.md**: This markdown file provides an overview of the project structure and purpose.

*(Note: Ensure the image files `Personal.png`, `Linkedin.jpeg`, and `Github.jpeg` are present in the root directory alongside the HTML files for the images to display correctly).*

## üîÆ Potential Future Improvements

*   Add CSS for styling and better layout.

*   Deploy the website to a hosting service (like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) to make it publicly accessible online.
