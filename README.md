## ‚ú® Overview

This project serves as a basic online presence, demonstrating fundamental web structure using HTML and styling using CSS. It consists of four interconnected pages:

1.  **Home (`index.html`):** A welcoming introduction with a profile picture and navigation links.
2.  **About Me (`about.html`):** Details about interests, hobbies, and a favorite quote.
3.  **Resume (`resume.html`):** Information on education, work experience, skills, and projects (presented in a table with links and images).
4.  **Contact Me (`contact.html`):** Contact information (Email, LinkedIn, GitHub) and a basic HTML form structure (currently non-functional for sending messages).

**Key CSS Features Added (`style.css`):**
*   Consistent styling across all pages using an external stylesheet.
*   Improved typography and readability using custom fonts (e.g., Google Fonts) and spacing.
*   Cohesive color palette for a professional look.
*   Use of relative units (`rem`, `em`) for better scalability.
*   Interactive elements with hover effects (`:hover`) and smooth transitions (`transition`).
*   Basic responsiveness using Media Queries for better display on different screen sizes.
*   (Potentially, depending on the CSS version used) Advanced styling like gradients, shadows, animations, CSS Variables, or Flexbox/Grid layouts.

## üîß Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** Used for structuring the content of all pages.
*   **CSS3:** Used for styling, layout, responsiveness, and adding visual appeal and basic interactivity (hover effects, transitions).

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main landing page.
- **about.html**: Page detailing personal interests and background.
- **resume.html**: Page showcasing professional and academic experiences.
- **contact.html**: Page with contact information and a basic form.
- **style.css**: **The external stylesheet containing all the visual rules.**
- **Personal.png**: Profile picture used on the landing page.
- **Linkedin.jpeg**: Image related to a project, used in the resume.
- **Github.jpeg**: Image related to a project, used in the resume.
- **README.md**: This markdown file providing project overview.

*(Note: Ensure all files, including `style.css` and image files, are present in the correct locations relative to the HTML files for the website to display correctly).*

## üîÆ Potential Future Improvements

*   Implement JavaScript for enhanced interactivity (e.g., making the contact form functional, adding dynamic animations, form validation).
*   Refine CSS, potentially using more advanced techniques like CSS Grid/Flexbox for complex layouts if not already implemented.
*   Further improve responsiveness for a wider range of devices.
*   Add accessibility (a11y) features.
*   Deploy the website to a hosting service (like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) to make it publicly accessible online.
*   Optimize images for faster loading times.
